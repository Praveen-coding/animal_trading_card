			<p class="set_margin">Despite living in trees squirrels are considered flightless because they can only jump short distances. They eat seeds, berries and pine cones too. Sometimes they eat bird's eggs and insects. Most tree squirrels store food in the fall, to eat in the winter. Ground squirrels do not store food.</p>
